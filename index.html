				<p> House Lannister of Casterly Rock is one of the Great Houses of Westeros, one of its richest and most powerful families and oldest dynasties. It is also the current royal house of the Seven Kingdoms following the extinction of House Baratheon of King's Landing.</p>
				<p>King Tommen, commits suicide after watching the Great Sept explode and hearing of the deaths. With his death, House Baratheon of King's Landing – and the main branch, House Baratheon - becomes officially extinct. With Qyburn as her Hand and no opposition, Cersei ascends to the Iron Throne, thus elevating House Lannister as the royal family and establishing a formal Lannister dynasty – something her late father had desired

				<p> House Targaryen is a former Great House of Westeros and was the ruling royal House of the Seven Kingdoms for three centuries, before it was deposed during Robert's Rebellion and House Baratheon replaced it as the new royal House. The few surviving Targaryens fled into exile. Currently based in Essos, House Targaryen seeks to retake the Seven Kingdoms from House Lannister, who formally replaced House Baratheon as the royal House following the destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor.Meanwhile, beyond the Wall, Bran Stark discovers that Daenerys isn't the last person with Targaryen blood. Rather, his alleged bastard half-brother, Jon Snow, is actually the son of Rhaegar Targaryen and Lyanna Stark, making him Daenerys's nephew.

				<p> House Baratheon of Storm's End is a legally extinct Great House of Westeros. Its main branch was formerly the royal house, but House Lannister now controls the throne.
				When the War of the Five Kings began following King Robert Baratheon's death, House Baratheon became divided into three distinct factions: one led by Robert's alleged son (who is actually the product of an incestuous relationship between Queen Cersei and Ser Jaime Lannister), Joffrey; one led by his younger brother, Stannis; and one led by his youngest brother, Renly.

				<p> House Tully of Riverrun is an exiled Great House of Westeros. Its most senior member carried the title of Lord of Riverrun and Lord Paramount of the Trident, until the Red Wedding. The current head is Lord Edmure Tully, son of the late Hoster Tully. Later, Ser Brynden Tully gathered the remaining Tully forces and reclaimed Riverrun from the Freys, reopening conflict between the Tullys and the Iron Throne. The Freys lay siege to Riverrun, and were later assisted by the Lannisters on the orders of King Tommen I. Ser Jaime Lannister managed to end the siege by convincing Edmure Tully to command the garrison to lay down their weapons in return for clemency and protection. Brynden was killed during a final stand with Lannister and Frey forces while Edmure was returned to the Freys as a prisoner.

Though loyal to the Iron Throne, the Martells were never conquered by the Targaryens and pursued a more isolated role in wider political events since Robert's Rebellion.With the assassinations of Prince Doran Martell and his only heir, Prince Trystane, by Ellaria Sand and the Sand Snakes, House Martell is legally extinct, although the Sand Snakes themselves carry Martell blood through their father Oberyn.

				<p> House Tyrell of Highgarden is one of the Great Houses of Westeros. It rules over the Reach, a vast, fertile, and heavily-populated region of southwestern Westeros, from their castle-seat, Highgarden. Formerly led by Lord Mace Tyrell, his mother, the indomitable Olenna Tyrell, stands as the last known member of the house. Mace's son Loras was a noted tournament knight (and, secretly, the lover of Lord Renly Baratheon). Mace's daughter Margaery married Renly when he crowned himself king, to cement the alliance between Renly and her father. Following Renly's death, Margaery was then married to King Joffrey Baratheon before his assassination at his wedding feast. She was then married to his younger brother, King Tommen Baratheon. Olenna Tyrell assumed House Tyrell's lordship as Margaery Tyrell, Loras Tyrell, and Mace Tyrell were killed by wildfire by at the destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor. Under Lady Olenna, who has served as the head of the house since, House Tyrell has aligned itself with House Targaryen in opposition against Queen Cersei I for orchestrating the demise of most of the main branch of the Tyrell family..
